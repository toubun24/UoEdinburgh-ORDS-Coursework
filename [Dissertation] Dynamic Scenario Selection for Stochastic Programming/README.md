# Dynamic-scenario-selection-for-stochastic-programming
Codes for algorithm implementing in this dissertation are constructed with MATLAB (including CVX module), while for figure displaying we adopt Plotly package in R. Also note that, the MATLAB codes for k-means clustering algorithm were original by Dr. Peter Richtarik in 2013, and then modified by Dr. Andreas Grothey in 2017, so this file is not included here.

Meanwhile, DOI is added for potential reference in future:
